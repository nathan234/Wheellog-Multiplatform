# Resources

A curated collection of references for EUC protocol development, open-source hardware, and the broader movement toward open PEV (personal electric vehicle) ecosystems.

The goal of WheelLog is to **democratize EUC connectivity** and help move the industry toward open-source hardware and firmware, similar to what VESC did for electric skateboards.

## Protocol Documentation

No EUC manufacturer publishes official BLE protocol specs. Everything below is reverse-engineered by the community.

### Community Protocol Docs

- [Gotway/KingSong Protocol Reverse-Engineering](https://forum.electricunicycle.org/topic/870-gotwaykingsong-protocol-reverse-engineering/) -- The foundational forum thread where esaj and others documented Gotway and KingSong BLE packet formats byte-by-byte.
- [Ninebot One BLE Protocol (9BMetrics)](https://www.gorina.es/9BMetrics/protocol.html) -- Paco Gorina's documentation of the Ninebot One protocol, including message format, command/response tables, and variable addresses.

### Source Code as Protocol Reference

The most complete and up-to-date protocol documentation is the decoder source code in open-source apps:

- **WheelLog KMP decoders** (`core/src/commonMain/.../protocol/`) -- KingsongDecoder, GotwayDecoder, VeteranDecoder, NinebotDecoder, NinebotZDecoder, InMotionDecoder, InMotionV2Decoder. The most current implementations covering all major brands.
- [EUC-Dash-ESP32](https://github.com/Pickelhaupt/EUC-Dash-ESP32) -- ESP32-based dashboard with KingSong protocol implementation in C/C++. Useful as an independent cross-reference.

- [GB Remote Lite (esk8.news)](https://forum.esk8.news/t/gb-remote-lite-open-source-vesc-remote/89620) -- Example of community-driven open hardware: a complete VESC remote designed and manufactured by the community.
- [DIY Onewheel on the Cheap (Hackaday)](https://hackaday.com/2022/01/03/diy-onewheel-on-the-cheap/) -- VESC balance app applied to a real self-balancing build.

## Community

- [NinebotCrypto](https://github.com/scooterhacking/NinebotCrypto) -- Implementation of Ninebot's encryption protocol used in newer devices.

## Where EUC Stands vs esk8

**What exists today:**
- Protocol decoders cover all major brands across multiple open-source apps
- VESC has a balance app capable of running a DIY EUC
- The EGG project proved a fully open-source EUC build is possible
- Several open-source BMS options work for EUC battery packs

**What's missing:**
- No production-ready open-source EUC controller (VESC balance app works, but no one has commercialized a VESC-based EUC board the way Flipsky did for esk8)
- No manufacturer-published protocol specifications (everything is reverse-engineered)
- DarknessBot (the dominant iOS app) is closed-source
- No open-source equivalent to manufacturer firmware (unlike scooters where ScooterHacking has custom firmware builders)
