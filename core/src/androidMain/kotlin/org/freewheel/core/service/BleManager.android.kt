/**
 * Android implementation of BleManager using the blessed-android library.
 *
 * This manager handles:
 * - BLE scanning for wheel devices
 * - Connection management with continuation-based connect
 * - Service discovery
 * - Characteristic read/write operations
 * - Connection state tracking
 * - Auto-reconnect on unexpected disconnect
 *
 * ## Session State Machine
 *
 * Internal BLE state is tracked via a `BleSessionState` sealed class that bundles
 * peripheral references and scan callbacks with the state variants that own them.
 * This makes illegal states unrepresentable at compile time:
 * - `Idle` and `Scanning` have no peripheral — can't accidentally use a stale one
 * - `disconnectRequested` is eliminated — intent is encoded by state
 *
 * The `session` var is `@Volatile` because it's read from the BLE HandlerThread
 * callbacks and written from the coroutine dispatcher.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * ```
 * val bleManager = BleManager()
 * bleManager.initialize(context)
 * bleManager.connect(address)
 * ```
