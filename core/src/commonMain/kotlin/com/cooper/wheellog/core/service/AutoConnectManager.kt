/**
 * Manages automatic connection to a wheel on app startup and reconnection
 * after connection loss with exponential backoff.
 *
 * Observes [ConnectionState] from [WheelConnectionManager] and reacts automatically:
 * - Clears startup auto-connect flag on Connected or Failed
 * - Stops reconnect loop on Connected
 *
 * Follows the same pattern as [KeepAliveTimer] and [DataTimeoutTracker]:
 * takes a [CoroutineScope] and [CoroutineDispatcher], exposes state via [StateFlow].
 *
 * @param connectionState Observable connection state to react to
 * @param connect Suspend function to initiate a connection to the given address
 * @param scope Coroutine scope for launching background work
 * @param dispatcher Dispatcher for background work (injectable for testing)
