/**
 * iOS implementation of BleManager using CoreBluetooth.
 *
 * This implementation uses Kotlin/Native interop with CoreBluetooth framework.
 *
 * ## Architecture
 *
 * The iOS BLE stack uses delegate-based callbacks:
 * - `CBCentralManagerDelegate` for connection management
 * - `CBPeripheralDelegate` for data and service discovery
 *
 * This class bridges the delegate pattern to Kotlin coroutines and StateFlow.
 *
 * ## Session State Machine
 *
 * Internal BLE state is tracked via a `BleSessionState` sealed class that bundles
 * peripheral references, scan callbacks, and discovery tracking with the state
 * variants that own them. This makes illegal states unrepresentable at compile time:
 * - `Idle` and `Scanning` have no peripheral — can't accidentally use a stale one
 * - `Discovering` owns a CoroutineScope that's cancelled on any transition away
 * - `disconnectRequested` is eliminated — intent is encoded by state
 *
 * ## Required Capabilities
 *
 * Add to Info.plist:
 * - `NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription` - Permission description
 * - `UIBackgroundModes` with `bluetooth-central` for background operation
