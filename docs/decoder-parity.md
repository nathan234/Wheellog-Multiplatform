# Decoder Parity Checklist

Tracks which legacy Android adapter behaviors have been replicated in the KMP decoders.
Updated after each migration pass. See also [protocol-quality-assessment.md](protocol-quality-assessment.md) for protocol quality comparison and [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) for decoder architecture.

Legend: `[x]` = implemented, `[ ]` = known gap, `[n/a]` = intentionally skipped

Gap priority: **[P1]** = affects real-world usage, **[P2]** = correctness/completeness, **[P3]** = minor/edge-case

### Known Gaps
- [ ] **[P1]** Nosfet Aero (mVer 43) SOC table: 126V/2P pack has a different voltage-SOC curve than Patton/Patton-S (126V/4P). Uses piecewise-linear fallback. Need real-world data or Leaperkim-provided table.
- [ ] **[P2]** Dual-format commands: official app sends old (LkAp) + new (LdAp) format concatenated for non-"004" firmware. We only send old format. May affect newer wheels.
- [ ] **[P2]** Lock command: requires time-based password prefix (`genPwdCmd` in official app). Currently returns empty.
- [ ] **[P2]** Oryx (mVer 8) SOC table: no official table available (not in Leaperkim app v1.4.8). Uses piecewise-linear fallback.
- [ ] **[P3]** Fall protection angle: parsed in sub-type 2 (byte 47) by official app but not surfaced in WheelState.
- [ ] **[P3]** Time sync on connect: official app sends time sync command on first valid frame.
- [ ] **[P3]** Sub-types 1/5 cell voltages (cells 1-15), 2/6 cells 16-30, 3/7 remaining cells + temps: not yet parsed (BMS data already comes from main frame for mVer >= 5).
